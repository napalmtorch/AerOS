# A Operating System build by some Friends, from scratch!

[![Build Status](http://144.76.18.59:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=AerOS)](https://github.com/napalmtorch/AerOS)

if you want to give this a try you can download the last build [here](http://144.76.18.59:8080/job/AerOS/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/AerOS.iso)

however to use the filesystem you will need to use our custom .img file which is located [here](https://github.com/napalmtorch/AerOS/blob/main/disks/nfs_disk.img)
since we use a custom Filesystem.

currently AerOS only works on Qemu (and some real hardware but not many)
for launch parameters see [here](https://github.com/napalmtorch/AerOS/blob/ff4d54f197e1df895a1fd6077357afd01a2af3f8/Makefile#L32)
